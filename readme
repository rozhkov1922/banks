Analysis of the outflow of bank customers.
I used python skills (pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, scipy, numpy) and also built a dashboard.

I analyzed the churn of a regional bank and identified customer segments that tend to leave the bank.
I conducted an exploratory data analysis, identified all significant signs of churn (ranges of characteristic values that are associated with increased churn, compare portraits of typical customers who
inclined and not inclined to leave the bank, etc.)
I formulated and tested statistical hypotheses. I tested the income difference hypothesis between those customers who left and those who stayed.
I formulated and tested a statistical hypothesis about the data presented to help clarify the study.
I combined the signs of perfection, formed segments, selected the best ones and gave recommendations on them
